## About  
Console application.
The program randomly generates a four-digit answer at the start.
After entering a number, the program provides feedback in the form of "X A, Y B" to guide the user.
Hint:
``` 
A: A digit is in the answer and in the correct position.  
B: A digit is in the answer but in a different position.  
```
The program also keeps track of the total number of attempts made by the player.
